# 🪨 Graphite
A library that allows developers to write custom Minecraft Classic servers.

Graphite has no default logic, which allows for full customizability and freedom for developing the server.

For now, this is an experimental ground to build a library for developing Minecraft Java (Specifically PVN 47) servers in the future.
